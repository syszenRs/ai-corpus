# Decision Frameworks

## Reversibility Matrix

| Decision Type                      | Approach                        |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| **Two-way door** (easily reversed) | Decide fast, learn from outcome |
| **One-way door** (hard to reverse) | Invest time in analysis         |

Most decisions are two-way doors. Don't over-analyze.

## Cost of Delay

```
Daily Cost = (Value Delivered / Time to Deliver) × Risk Factor
```

Use when prioritizing:

- High daily cost → Do first
- Low daily cost → Can wait

## RICE Scoring

| Factor         | Question                 | Scale               |
| -------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------- |
| **R**each      | How many users affected? | # users/period      |
| **I**mpact     | How much per user?       | 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 3  |
| **C**onfidence | How sure are we?         | 20%, 50%, 80%, 100% |
| **E**ffort     | Person-weeks             | 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8+    |

```
RICE = (Reach × Impact × Confidence) / Effort
```

## Technical Decision Checklist

Before committing to a technical approach:

- [ ] Have we talked to someone who's done this before?
- [ ] What's the simplest version that teaches us something?
- [ ] What would make us reverse this decision?
- [ ] Who maintains this in 6 months?
- [ ] What's our rollback plan?

## When to Build vs Buy vs Adopt

| Signal                   | Build | Buy   | Adopt (OSS) |
| ------------------------ | ----- | ----- | ----------- |
| Core differentiator      | Yes   | No    | Maybe       |
| Commodity problem        | No    | Yes   | Yes         |
| Tight integration needed | Yes   | Maybe | Maybe       |
| Team has expertise       | Yes   | N/A   | Yes         |
| Time pressure            | No    | Yes   | Maybe       |
| Long-term control needed | Yes   | No    | Maybe       |

## Decomposition Strategies

### Vertical Slicing

Cut features into thin end-to-end slices that deliver value:

```
Bad:  "Build database layer" → "Build API" → "Build UI"
Good: "User can see their profile" → "User can edit name" → "User can upload avatar"
```

### Risk-First Ordering

1. Identify highest-risk unknowns
2. Build spike/proof-of-concept for those first
3. Then build around proven foundation

### Dependency Mapping

```
[Feature A] ─depends on→ [Feature B] ─depends on→ [Feature C]
                                                      ↑
                                                 Start here
```
