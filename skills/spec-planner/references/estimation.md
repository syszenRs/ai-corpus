# Estimation

## Why Estimates Fail

| Cause                 | Mitigation                      |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Optimism bias         | Use historical data, not gut    |
| Missing scope         | List "obvious" tasks explicitly |
| Integration blindness | Add 20-30% for glue code        |
| Unknown unknowns      | Add buffer based on novelty     |
| Interruptions         | Assume 60% focused time         |

## Estimation Techniques

### Three-Point Estimation

```
Expected = (Optimistic + 4×MostLikely + Pessimistic) / 6
```

### Relative Sizing

Compare to known references:

- "This is about twice as complex as Feature X"
- Use Fibonacci (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13) to reflect uncertainty

### Task Decomposition

1. Break into tasks ≤4 hours
2. If can't decompose, spike first
3. Sum tasks + 20% integration buffer

## Effort Multipliers

| Factor                                    | Multiplier |
| ----------------------------------------- | ---------- |
| New technology                            | 1.5-2×     |
| Unclear requirements                      | 1.3-1.5×   |
| External dependencies (waiting on others) | 1.2-1.5×   |
| Legacy/undocumented code                  | 1.3-2×     |
| Production deployment                     | 1.2×       |
| First time doing X                        | 2-3×       |
| Context switching (other priorities)      | 1.3×       |
| Yak shaving risk (unknown unknowns)       | 1.5×       |

## Hidden Work Checklist

Always include time for:

- [ ] Code review (20% of dev time)
- [ ] Testing (30-50% of dev time)
- [ ] Documentation (10% of dev time)
- [ ] Deployment/config (varies)
- [ ] Bug fixes from testing (20% buffer)
- [ ] Interruptions / competing priorities

## When to Re-Estimate

Re-estimate when:

- Scope changes materially
- Major unknown becomes known
- Actual progress diverges >30% from estimate

## Communicating Estimates

**Good:** "1-2 weeks, confidence 70%—main risk is the third-party API integration"

**Bad:** "About 2 weeks"

Always include:

1. Range, not point estimate
2. Confidence level
3. Key assumptions/risks
